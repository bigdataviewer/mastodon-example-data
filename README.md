# mastodon-example-data

This repository contains example datasets for the Mastodon cell-tracking plugin.

## Dataset: tgmm-mini
### Origin
This dataset was created from the example dataset released with the TGMM software
(https://www.janelia.org/lab/keller-lab/software/fast-accurate-reconstruction-cell-lineages-large-scale-fluorescence).

The image data was converted from TIFs into BigDataViewer HDF5/XML.
The tracks were imported from TGMMs XML output files into Mastodon.
