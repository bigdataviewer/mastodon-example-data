# mastodon-example-data

This repository contains example datasets for the Mastodon cell-tracking plugin.

## Dataset: tgmm-mini
### Origin
This dataset was created from the example dataset released with the TGMM software
(https://www.janelia.org/lab/keller-lab/software/fast-accurate-reconstruction-cell-lineages-large-scale-fluorescence).

The image data was converted from TIFs into BigDataViewer HDF5/XML.
The tracks were imported from TGMMs XML output files into Mastodon.

## Dataset: astec

### Origin

* This dataset originates from the Phallusia mammillata embryonic development dataset, which was published on
  figshare.
    * https://figshare.com/projects/Phallusiamammillata_embryonic_development/64301.
* The dataset is described in the following publication:
    * Léo Guignard et al., Contact area–dependent cell communication and the morphological invariance of ascidian
      embryogenesis. Science369, eaar5663(2020). DOI:[10.1126/science.aar5663](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar5663)
* The dataset has been converted to Mastodon file format using these scripts:
    * Astec file format to CSV: https://github.com/GuignardLab/LineageTree/blob/master/src/LineageTree/legacy/export_csv.py
    * CSV to Mastodon file
      format: https://github.com/mastodon-sc/mastodon-deep-lineage/blob/master/src/test/java/org/mastodon/mamut/astec/AstecReader.java
* Limitations resulting from the conversion:
    * Image data is not included in the projects. This would require additional effort. However, it is probably not
      necessary
      for the intended use cases (tests of lineage clustering, lineage registration, and Blender visualization).
    * Only datasets Pm01 – Pm10 have been converted.
    * The cell names were missing for Pm11-Pm13. To handle this, the conversion scripts would need to be adapted. Thus,
      these datasets are not included.
    * The uploaded data for Pm14 is faulty on figshare. Thus it is not included.
    * Half-Pm1, U0126PM1 and U0126PM2 do not contain lineage or coordinates. Thus, these datasets are not included.
    * When opening the Mastodon projects, a message appears stating that the image data is missing. It can be chosen, to
      open the project without image data ("dummy image data"). This must be confirmed. After that, it should work.
